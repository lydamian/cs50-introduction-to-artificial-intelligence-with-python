## Question 1
Between depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS), which will find a shorter path through a maze?

- BFS will sometimes, but not always, find a shorter path than DFS

## Question 2
Of the four search algorithms discussed in lecture — depth-first search, breadth-first search, greedy best-first search with Manhattan distance heuristic, and A* search with Manhattan distance heuristic — which one (or multiple, if multiple are possible) could be the algorithm used?

- Could only be DFS

## Question 3
Why is depth-limited minimax sometimes preferable to minimax without a depth limit?

- Depth-limited minimax can arrive at a decision more quickly because it explores fewer states

## Question 4
Consider the Minimax tree below, where the green up arrows indicate the MAX player and red down arrows indicate the MIN player. The leaf nodes are each labelled with their value.
